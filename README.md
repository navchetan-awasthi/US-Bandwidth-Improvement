# US_Bandwidth_Improvement
This directory contains all the code to run all the models as well as code to calculate the metric values for the model outputs.
Each model variation for each architecture has a seperate notebook. 
So 3 for each architecture: RED-net(residual encoder decoder), U-net and SRCNN. 

The calculate_metrics notebook contains all the code neccesary to save the RMSE,and PSNR values in an excel file for all the models. It also contains code to save either a small part or a full image for all models and test data and saves them in a folder.
